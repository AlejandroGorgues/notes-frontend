# notes-frontend
This repository contains the code to run the frontend related to the notes project developed on the [fulltackopen](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) free course of the Helsinki University.

More specifically, this code is used by the backend repository to generate a dist folder to communicate directly to the backend on the same url to deploy one time.

The link to the backend repository is (here)[https://github.com/AlejandroGorgues/notes-backend].
